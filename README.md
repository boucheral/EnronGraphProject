# EnronGraphProject

### Data Cleaning
- I used Python to extract the emails from the original format in the Enron folder
- I only used the top 150 which sent and recieved the most emails
- Then I put it in a format which would be easy to read into the java application
- file structure :
  - Enron
    - Data (Files from the original go here)
    - Emails (The resulting txt files will go here)
    - Python Notebook with the code
    
### To run :
- in com.ab.test.Reader update FILENAME to the location of the unzipped Emails folder
- You can run it as an Eclipse project or compile it and run it that way
